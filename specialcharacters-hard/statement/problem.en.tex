\problemname{Interactive Communication}

Your solution will be run in two stages. The stages are independent and you cannot pass information between them.

In stage 1, you are given a binary string of length $N$ that you want to communicate to stage 2. To do this, you can send 
number $0-3$ inclusive. You have to send them one by one, and before each one, the judge will arbitrarily disallow sending
one of the the 4 available numbers.

First, read string, which is either \texttt{encrypt} or \texttt{decrypt}. If it's \texttt{encrypt}, your program
is being run in stage 1, otherwise stage 2.

\section*{Stage 1}
Read a string, the binary string you have to communicate. Assume it consists of $N$ characters.
Then, $N$ times, do the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Read one character $c$ on one line. This is the disallowed character.
  \item Send some character not equal to $c$. Remember to send a newline and flush afterwards.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Stage 2}
Read a string. This will be equal to what your program outputted during stage 1. Your program
has to use this string to figure out what the original binary string was in stage 1. 

Thus, print a binary string of length $N$. If it matches the one given in stage 1, your program
has solved the testcase.
